I used the web server software XAMPP as it was part of a syntactical requirement.
While doing an xmlHTTPRequest call to the QuizData.json file, I had to use a url link and not just give an absolute or relative path to the JSON data file in my local machine.
I hope this wont be a criteria that will proove to be an error in my code.
